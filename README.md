Check if one main subject per line works


Use reference in member of to state from when to when

If main topic does not work, think about how to use non-wiki data

Sponsor is not the best field because there are multiple grants and papers before the cluster was created

Disconsider relative weight ofr the time being

Do not infer a ubject if there is not one

## Most realistic approach is to:

1. do for two authors
2. see all viz

3. go back and do for reminder of the cluster.
    * It alleviates work on my end as someone else can do the open refine checks while I work on viz
